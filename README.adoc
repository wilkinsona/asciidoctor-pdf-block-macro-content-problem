== AsciiDoctor PDF block macro content problem

This repository contains a reproduction of a problem with `asciidoctor-pdf` not including all of
the content that's produced by a `BlockMacroProcessor` extension.

The problem can be reproduced using `asciidoctor-pdf`:

----
$ asciidoctor-pdf -r ./extension.rb index.adoc
----

The resulting PDF will contain the titles of the sections added by the `BlockMacroProcessor` but
will not contain their content. By constrast, the HTML output produced by `asciidoctor` will
contain both the titles and the content of the sections.
